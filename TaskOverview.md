TASK OVERVIEW:

- Consider uploading the data-examples from a connected GoogleDrive instead of 
having to commit via bash (which takes a loooong time)

- Also, consider much smaller data set for testing

- In Main_Folder_Walk.py, check if stack is actually made, instead of just checking
 if the folder is empty
